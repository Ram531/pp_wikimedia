- Prepare a Readme.MD
- Why certain decisions are taken? (Why I shifted things from Pull or push)
- How can we do things differently now?
- What are the cost considerations made and where things made wrong?
- What would be the next steps for improvement?
- How to make the things more robust? (Unit tests, etc)
- Add docstings
- What are the next directions that will develop this solution? (For example, if a user want to know the number of edits for a particular category, he can feed it to an LLM)
- Comback 3 months from now, how will you get to speed immediately? What should you read to enable that?
- Apply GIT principles. Put into a git repo if I want to include this to my portfolio when applying for a job.)

(MONDAY DM DAILY 12:45PM IS THE HARD STOP) for this.
